# 🦀 Advanced Rust Learning Roadmap

> A structured path from Rust fundamentals to production-ready systems programming.

---

## 📍 Phase 1 — Core Safety & Patterns
*Status: Mid-way* ✅

- [ ] Ownership deep dive & advanced borrowing patterns
- [ ] Structs & nested structs, disjoint field borrows
- [ ] Enums with data, pattern matching, exhaustive matches
- [ ] `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>` with chaining, combinators (`map`, `and_then`)
- [ ] Slices & `Vec<T>` advanced usage
- [ ] Iterators (`map`, `filter`, `enumerate`, `.collect()`)
- [ ] `String` & heap memory handling
- [ ] Method definitions, references in functions, mutable vs immutable

---

## 📍 Phase 2 — Traits & Generics

- [ ] Traits (like interfaces)
- [ ] `impl` blocks for structs
- [ ] `dyn Trait` and dynamic dispatch
- [ ] Generics with structs, functions, and enums
- [ ] Trait bounds (`T: Trait`)
- [ ] Operator overloading with traits (`Add`, `Index`, etc.)

---

## 📍 Phase 3 — Error Handling & Pipelines

- [ ] Advanced `Option`/`Result` pipelines
- [ ] `?` operator & error propagation
- [ ] Custom error types (`enum Error`)
- [ ] `.map_err()`, `.and_then()` for chaining
- [ ] Real-world safe pipelines with multiple functions

---

## 📍 Phase 4 — Collections & Data Structures

- [ ] `VecDeque`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`
- [ ] Nested collections
- [ ] Borrowing rules for collections
- [ ] Iterators for collections (`.iter()`, `.iter_mut()`)
- [ ] `.collect()` into different types

---

## 📍 Phase 5 — Lifetimes & References

- [ ] Lifetime annotations (`'a`)
- [ ] Structs with references
- [ ] Functions returning references
- [ ] Lifetime elision rules
- [ ] Complex borrowing scenarios
- [ ] How lifetimes interact with `Option`/`Result` & iterators

---

## 📍 Phase 6 — Concurrency & Async

- [ ] Threads (`std::thread`) and shared memory (`Arc`, `Mutex`)
- [ ] Channels (`std::sync::mpsc`)
- [ ] Async/await (`async fn`, `.await`)
- [ ] Futures & Streams
- [ ] Tokio / async ecosystem

---

## 📍 Phase 7 — Modules, Crates & Packaging

- [ ] Modules & `mod`, `pub`, `use`
- [ ] Packages & Cargo workspace
- [ ] External crates & version management
- [ ] Features & conditional compilation
- [ ] Documentation & Rustdoc

---

## 📍 Phase 8 — Macros & Advanced Patterns

- [ ] `macro_rules!` for declarative macros
- [ ] Procedural macros
- [ ] Attribute macros
- [ ] Common Rust patterns (Builder, RAII, newtype, etc.)
- [ ] Zero-cost abstractions

---

## 📍 Phase 9 — Real Backend/Systems Rust

- [ ] HTTP server: Axum / Actix / Rocket
- [ ] Database access: SQLx / Diesel
- [ ] Logging, tracing, metrics
- [ ] Configuration management
- [ ] Error handling across services
- [ ] `Option`/`Result` safe pipelines in practice
- [ ] Structs + Enums modeling real-world entities
- [ ] Async patterns in real backend logic

---

## 🔬 Optional Deep Dives

- [ ] **Unsafe Rust** — when & how to use `unsafe` safely
- [ ] **FFI** — calling C / Python / other languages
- [ ] **Custom allocators**
- [ ] **Procedural code generation**

## 🎯 Suggested Learning Order

| Step | Topic | Priority |
|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Finish `Option` + `Result` pipelines | 🔴 High |
| 2 | Dive into Traits + Generics | 🔴 High |
| 3 | Deepen Collections + Iterators | 🟡 Medium |
| 4 | Understand Lifetimes fully | 🟡 Medium |
| 5 | Async / Concurrency | 🟡 Medium |
| 6 | Real-world backend code | 🟢 Apply |

---

## 📝 Notes

> **Tip:** Practice each phase with small code examples before moving on. Understanding ownership and borrowing deeply will make everything else easier.
